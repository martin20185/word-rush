<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Push your typing skills to the limit as you save the city from falling nukes. <a href="http://martinivnv.github.io/word-rush">Click here to play!</a>
This is the very first project I ever created using JavaScript, written in December 2018. Going in, I knew absolutely nothing about JS, HTML, or CSS. This is reflected in the minimalist design of the game. I wrote it mostly by looking at how other in browser games were written and following the patterns and examples I saw to create something original that fit my vision. Although I did not fully know what objects were at the time, I incorporated them very effectively here to fit the needs of the project. I also did a very thorough job commenting the code, making it easy to follow.
An improvement I would make would be write the code utilizing more of the OOP conventions that I know now to make the code more readable and easier to edit. I would also create a more interesting and complex layout to the website using my present knowledge of CSS and HTML.
